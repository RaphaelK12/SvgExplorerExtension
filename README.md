# SVG Viewer Extension for Windows Explorer
Extension module for Windows Explorer to render SVG thumbnails, so that you can have an overview of your SVG files.

## Build

The easiest way to build it is with the provided Qt project file. I suggest to use Qt Creator. Requirements:
* Qt SDK
* Windows 7 SDK
* Qt SDK 64 bit (for 64 bit builds only) NOTE: You have to compile Qt for 64 bit by yourself.
